# Python List and Tuple Practice

This repository contains a curated collection of **Python practice programs** focused on **Lists and Tuples**, two of the most fundamental data structures in Python.

The purpose of this repository is to strengthen core Python concepts, improve problem-solving skills, and build a solid foundation.

## Concepts Covered

### Lists

* Indexing and slicing
* Element replacement vs insertion
* List methods: `append()`, `insert()`, `remove()`, `pop()`
* Removing duplicates
* Reversing and rotating lists
* Palindrome checks
* Finding second largest element
* Flattening nested lists
* Method chaining behavior and limitations

### Tuples

* Tuple fundamentals and immutability
* Tuple unpacking
* Converting between lists and tuples
* Counting and indexing elements manually
* Removing duplicate elements
* Mutable objects inside tuples
* Common interview-oriented tuple problems

---

##  Key Takeaways

* Lists are **mutable**, allowing in-place modification of elements
* Tuples are **immutable**, making them safer for fixed data
* `pop()` removes elements by index and returns the removed value
* `remove()` deletes elements by value and returns `None`
* Most list methods modify data in place and do not support chaining
* Method chaining is possible only when methods return a value
